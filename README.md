# PepperPrepper

PepperPrepper is a way for me to learn to work with geospatial data using TensorFlow. It will be a Python backend that uses current and predicted daily weather data to help me decide whether to put my green chile outside and water it for maximum spiciness.

## TODO
- [ ] Load historical min temp and use it to predict the next 7 days.
